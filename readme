1. The GSL and the Cuba library have to be installed.
2. If the GSL or Cuba is not installed in the standard system directory, open "Makefile" contained in the MultiDimInt root directory, and set the variables "GSL_INCLUDE_PATH", "GSL_LIB_PATH" and "CUBA_PATH" to the appropriate paths. Do not modify the rest of the file.
3. Open a terminal in the MultiDimInt root directory and run "make". This builds MultiDimInt and generates a library file "libmultidimint.a" in the root directory.
4. To use MultiDimInt in your own code, link your program to "libmultidimint.a" as well as the GSL and Cuba, and include the header file "MultiDimInt.h".
5. If Doxygen is installed, one can also generate the documentation of MultiDimInt by running "make doc" in the root directory. Afterwards, the documentation can be found under "doc/documentation.html".
6. A few small programs demonstrating the usage of MultiDimInt can be found in the directory "demo". If you modify these, just run "make" in the MultiDimInt root directory to rebuild them.
